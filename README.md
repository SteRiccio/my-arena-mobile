# My Arena Mobile

**UNOFFICIAL (experimental) version of Open Foris Arena Mobile**

The use of this application is not recomended by the Open Foris team and it is at your own risk...!
This doesn't mean that I won't support it... but I can do it only in my free time.

This version of Arena Mobile has been developed entirely by me (Stefano Ricci), main developer of Open Foris Collect, Collect Mobile and Arena.

If you find this application more reactive and easy to use compared to the official one, or you like some feature not included in the official one, please tell it here in GitHub creating a new Issue, or open a question in the Open Foris support forum.

App logo is free and provided by [Wire Vectors by Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/wire).

Cheers and enjoy the spaghetti code in this repository!
