# Arena Mobile Experiments

**Experimental version of Open Foris Arena Mobile**

The use of this application is not recomended by the Open Foris team and it is at your own risk...!

This application has been developed entirely by me (Stefano Ricci), main developer of Open Foris Collect, Collect Mobile and Arena.
It is to be considered only as a playground to test new features that will be included (maybe) in the official version of Arena Mobile.

App logo is free and provided by [Wire Vectors by Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/wire).

Cheers and enjoy the spaghetti code in this repository!
