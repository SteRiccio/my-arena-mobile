# Arena Mobile Experiments

**Alternative version of Open Foris Arena Mobile**

This application has been developed entirely by me (Stefano Ricci), main developer of Open Foris Collect, Collect Mobile and Arena.
This version of Arena Mobile includes features that will be included in the official version of Arena Mobile in a near future.

Cheers and enjoy the spaghetti code in this repository!
